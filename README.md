# Govt-dataset: Innovate with GoIStats Hackathon Submission

This repository contains our team’s submission for the “Innovate with GoIStats” Hackathon, organized by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) and MyGov. Our goal was to explore official government datasets and create clear, helpful visualizations that bring out important insights for policy-makers and the public.

## About Our Submission

We focused on using authentic data published by MoSPI

For each topic, we picked relevant tables and figures, processed the data, and built visualizations that make the findings easier to understand. All the analysis and visuals are included as PDF reports in this repository.

## What We Did

- **Collected and cleaned data** from the official MoSPI sources.
- **Analyzed key trends** in employment, industry, and consumption.
- **Created easy-to-read charts and dashboards** using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Documented our steps and findings** in the attached reports.
- **Included all code** and details of data sources for transparency and reproducibility.

## How to Use

- The PDF files show our main findings and visualizations.
- The code and data processing steps can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks.
- Each report clearly mentions the source, year, and exact tables used.

## Team & Acknowledgements

We are students and researchers passionate about turning raw data into something meaningful.
